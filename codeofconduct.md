# Project Code of Conduct

## 1. Expected Behavior
All team members are expected to:
- Show respect and professionalism in all communications
- Meet agreed-upon deadlines and responsibilities
- Give constructive, kind feedback
- Credit others' work appropriately
- Maintain academic integrity (no plagiarism/AI use as per assessment brief)
- Keep project discussions focused and productive

## 2. Collaboration Guidelines
### Working Together:
- Use GitHub for all code/documentation
- Follow GitFlow branching strategy
- Document all major decisions in GitHub Discussions
- Daily standups (brief progress updates) via Teams/WhatsApp

### Code Reviews:
- All PRs require ≥1 reviewer approval
- Review within 24 hours when possible
- Use the "STAR" feedback method:
  - **S**ituation: Where the code appears
  - **T**hing: What you're commenting on
  - **A**ction: Suggested change
  - **R**esult: Expected improvement

## 3. Conflict Resolution
### Escalation Process:
1. **Direct Discussion**: Team members resolve privately
2. **Scrum Master Mediation**: If unresolved after 24h
3. **Tutor Involvement**: Only if mediation fails

### Ground Rules:
- Focus on technical issues, not personalities
- Use "I" statements ("I feel concerned about..." not "You always...")
- Document agreed solutions in GitHub Wiki

## 4. Contribution Standards
### Coding:
- Follow C# naming conventions
- Document public methods with XML comments
- Keep methods under 25 lines where possible
- Test coverage for new features

### Non-Code:
- Update documentation concurrently
- Use Markdown formatting
- Add diagrams for complex workflows

## 5. Communication Protocols
### Channels:
- **Urgent**: WhatsApp/Teams call
- **Code Discussions**: GitHub PR comments
- **Planning**: GitHub Projects board
- **Meetings**: Record Zoom sessions (with consent)

### Response Times:
- Urgent: ≤2 hours
- PR reviews: ≤24 hours
- General messages: ≤12 hours

## Enforcement
Violations will be addressed through:
1. Private reminder from Scrum Master
2. Team discussion with tutor present
3. Formal reporting to module leader if unresolved
